# Planning-First Development Workflow

This document explains the enhanced planning-first workflow implemented in the Autonomous Coding Agent, designed to provide detailed implementation planning before any code changes.

## 🎯 Overview

The planning-first approach ensures every task receives comprehensive analysis and strategic planning before implementation begins. This results in:

- **Higher Quality**: Thoughtful planning leads to better implementation
- **Transparency**: All stakeholders can review plans before implementation
- **Efficiency**: Clear plans reduce implementation time and errors
- **Consistency**: Standardized planning process across all tasks

## 📋 Planning Process

### 1. Repository Analysis

When a webhook is triggered, the system first performs deep repository analysis:

```
📊 Analysis Includes:
├── Technology Stack Detection
├── Architecture Pattern Recognition  
├── Code Organization Assessment
├── Dependency Analysis
├── Testing Framework Identification
├── Build System Understanding
└── Integration Point Mapping
```

### 2. Comprehensive Plan Generation

Using Claude AI, the system generates a detailed implementation plan with:

- **Requirements Analysis**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Technical Approach**: Architecture decisions and design patterns
- **Implementation Strategy**: Step-by-step development phases
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies
- **Performance Considerations**: Optimization and scalability planning

### 3. Claude Development Environment

Each repository is configured with optimal Claude Code development setup:

### 3. Test the Planning Workflow

```bash
# Manual trigger with planning
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/tasks/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/org/repo",
    "taskData": {

3. **Analyze Setup**: Verify Claude configuration in repository

## 📚 Advanced Features

### Custom MCP Servers

Create project-specific MCP servers for specialized functionality:

```javascript
// Custom server for project-specific tools
class ProjectMCPServer {
  async runProjectTests() {
    // Custom test execution logic
  }
  
  async analyzePerformance() {
    // Performance analysis tools
  }
  
  async validateSecurity() {
    // Security validation checks
  }
}
```

### Planning Templates

Customize planning templates for different project types:

- **Frontend Projects**: Focus on UI/UX and component structure
- **Backend APIs**: Emphasize endpoints and data modeling
- **Mobile Apps**: Consider platform-specific requirements
- **Data Science**: Include model validation and performance metrics

### Integration Hooks

The planning system provides hooks for custom integrations:

```typescript
// Custom planning enhancement
interface PlanningHook {
  beforePlanning(context: RepoContext): Promise<void>;
  afterPlanning(plan: PlanResult): Promise<PlanResult>;
  onImplementationStart(plan: PlanResult): Promise<void>;
}
```

This planning-first approach transforms autonomous coding from reactive task execution to proactive, strategic development that produces higher quality results with complete transparency and stakeholder visibility.
