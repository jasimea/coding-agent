# Autonomous Coding Agent

A powerful autonomous coding agent built with TypeScript, Express, and the Vercel AI SDK. This agent can perform file operations, git operations, execute system commands, and help with various software development tasks.

## üöÄ Features

- **File Operations**: Read, write, create, delete, copy, move files and directories
- **Git Operations**: Status, add, commit, push, pull, branch management, and more
- **Command Execution**: Execute system commands and scripts safely
- **Project Analysis**: Analyze project structure, detect languages, and provide insights
- **Express API**: RESTful API endpoints for integration
- **CLI Interface**: Interactive command-line interface
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time streaming responses
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google AI
- **Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and path safety checks
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging with Winston

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd coding-agent
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Configure your AI provider by setting one of these environment variables:
```bash
# For OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# For Anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# For Google AI
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
```

### Security Configuration
- `JWT_SECRET`: JWT secret for authentication
- `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`: Rate limit window in milliseconds
- `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`: Maximum requests per window

### Agent Configuration
- `MAX_EXECUTION_TIME_MS`: Maximum execution time for tasks
- `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`: Maximum file size for operations
- `ALLOWED_FILE_EXTENSIONS`: Comma-separated list of allowed file extensions

### Git Configuration
- `DEFAULT_GIT_BRANCH`: Default git branch name

- `LOG_FILE`: Log file path

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Path Safety
- All file operations are restricted to the project directory
- Path traversal attacks are prevented
- Absolute paths are resolved and validated

### Command Safety
- Dangerous commands are blocked
- Restricted system paths are protected
- Environment variables are sanitized

### Rate Limiting
- API endpoints are rate-limited
- Configurable limits per IP address
- Proper HTTP headers for rate limit information

### Input Validation
- All API inputs are validated using Zod schemas
- Proper error handling and sanitization
- Size limits on file operations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Key Not Found**
- Make sure you've set the appropriate AI provider API key in your `.env` file
- Verify the environment variable name matches the provider you want to use

**Permission Denied**
- Check file permissions in your project directory
- Ensure the agent has read/write access to necessary files
- Verify git repository permissions for git operations

**Rate Limit Exceeded**
- Wait for the rate limit window to reset
- Adjust rate limit configuration if needed
- Consider implementing authentication for higher limits

**Command Execution Failed**
- Verify the command exists and is accessible
- Check working directory and environment variables
- Review security restrictions for dangerous commands

### Debug Mode

Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` in your environment to enable detailed logging for troubleshooting.
