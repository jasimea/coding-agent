# Git Workflow Test

This file is created to test the automated Git workflow implemented in the coding agent.

## Features

- Automatic branch creation for each task
- Proper commit messages
- Automatic pull request creation
- Integration with GitHub API using Octokit

## Workflow Steps

1. **Planning Phase**: Agent creates a detailed plan with Git workflow information
2. **Setup Phase**: Creates a feature branch and switches to it
3. **Execution Phase**: Performs the actual task (file operations, coding, etc.)
4. **Completion Phase**: Commits changes and creates a pull request

## Configuration Required

- GitHub token with `repo` scope
- Git repository with GitHub remote
- Proper environment variables set

This demonstrates the new automated workflow implementation.
